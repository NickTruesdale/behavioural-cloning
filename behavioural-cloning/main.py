This is the main entry point for the behavioural cloning model.
It spins up a flask server and websocket to communicate with Unity,
which is running the Udacity self-driving car simulation.

Images are received fron Unity, and driving input is returned.

Note: This code is re-implemented by Nick Truesdale, but conceptually
is mostly lifted from the tutorial by Siraj Raval.
